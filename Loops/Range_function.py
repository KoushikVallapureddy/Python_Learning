'''
The range() function in Python generates a sequence of numbers, 
which is commonly used with for loops to repeat code a specific number of times.
Create a range that starts at 0 and ends at 4:
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
This will output:
0
1
2
3
4
You can also specify a start value:
for i in range(2, 6):
    print(i)
This will output:
2
3
4
5
And you can specify a step value (increment):
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)
This will output:
1
3
5
7
9
