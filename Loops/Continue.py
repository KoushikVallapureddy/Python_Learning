'''
The continue statement stops the current iteration and continues to the next iteration. 
For example:
for i in range(3, 9):
    if i == 5:
        continue
    print(i)
The loop will iterate through the numbers from 3 to 8, and when it reaches i=5 it will skip that iteration and continue to the next one. The output is:
3
4
6
7
8
