"""
Naming convention for Python files: Naming conventions are the set of guidelines that developers follow to make their code more readable and maintainable. Different programming languages often have different naming conventions.In Python, file names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores. This is known as snake_case. For example, a file containing functions related to boolean operations might be named boolean_operations.py.
This convention helps in identifying the purpose of the file at a glance and is consistent with Python's
naming style for variables and functions.
