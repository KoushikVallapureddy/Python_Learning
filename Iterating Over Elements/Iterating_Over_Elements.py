Iterating Over Elements:
Iteration means going through elements one by one in a sequence. 
With lists, we can access each element systematically using different methods.
The most common way to iterate through a list is using a for loop:
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
    for fruit in fruits:
        print(fruit)
Output:
    apple
    banana
    orange
