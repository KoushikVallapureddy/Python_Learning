Methods:
Methods are functions that belong to a class. They define the behaviors or actions that objects can perform.

Here is an example of a class with methods:
    class Calculator:
        def greet(self):
            print("Hello! I'm a calculator.")
        
        def add(self, a, b):
            return a + b
        
        def multiply(self, x, y):
            result = x * y
            print(f"{x} × {y} = {result}")
            return result

Create a calculator object:
    my_calc = Calculator()

Call a method that doesn't need parameters:
    my_calc.greet()

Call methods with parameters:
    sum_result = my_calc.add(5, 3)
    print(sum_result)

Call a method that both prints and returns a value:
    product = my_calc.multiply(4, 7)

Output:
    Hello! I'm a calculator.
    8
    4 × 7 = 28

Methods can:
    Take parameters like add(self, a, b)
    Return values like return a + b
    Print output directly like print("Hello!")
    Do both printing and returning
    
Key Point: Methods define what your objects can do. Always include self as the first parameter, but don't pass it when calling the method.
