'''
Return Function:
The return statement in a function is used to specify the value or values that
the function should produce as its output.
For example, the following function will output 100:
    def function_name():
        return 100
To pass the value to a variable, write:
    number = function_name()
Now the number variable will hold 100 because this is what the function returned.
