Variable declaration and printing in Python: 
Variables are containers for storing data values. In Python, you can declare a variable by simply assigning a value to it using the equals sign (=). Each variable can hold a value of any data type, such as integers, strings, or booleans.Python is capable of automatically determining the type of a variable based on the value assigned to it.
For example, you can declare a variable named 'var' and assign it to int 5 or float 1.4
"""
var = 5
print(f'var = {var}')


"""
Empyt Variable in Python:
An empty variable in Python is a variable that has been declared but not assigned any value. In Python, None is a special value that represents "Nothing or "No Value". It's like an empty box=it exists, but there is nothing inside it.
For example: empty_box = None. 
In a real senario you could use None to indicate that something was not intialized yet or that a variable is intentionally left blank.
For example: 
score = None #Score has not calculated yet
name = None #Name hasn't been entered yet 
"""

#Type code 
nothing = None
print(f'nothing = {nothing}')


#Challenge:

K = 88
Pi = 3.14
name = "Kaushik"
print(f'K = {K}')
print(f"Pi = {Pi}")
print(f'name = "{name}"')
