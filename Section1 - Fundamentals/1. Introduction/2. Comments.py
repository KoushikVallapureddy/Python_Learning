"""
Comments in Python are used to explain code and make it more readable.
They are ignored by the Python interpreter and do not affect the execution of the program.
Single-line comments start with a hash symbol (#), while multi-line comments can be enclosed in triple quotes ('''''' or """""").
"""

#Code Exmaple:

#this is a single-line comment
print('My name is Koushik')

"""This is a multi-line comment using double quotations.
It can span multiple lines and is often used to provide detailed explanations"""
print('I am learning Python')  

'''This is a multi-line comment using single quotations.
It can also span multiple lines and is useful for longer comments or documentation'''
print('Python is fun!')
