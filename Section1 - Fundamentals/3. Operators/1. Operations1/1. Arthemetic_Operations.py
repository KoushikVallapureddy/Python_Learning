Operations: 
Operators are used to perform operations on values. 
Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Python has many built-in operators that allow you to perform arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operations.
Operators: +, - , *, /, %, //, **, ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, and, or, not, &, |, ^, <<, >>.
Operation: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Floor Division, Exponentiation, Comparison, Logical, Bitwise.
Example: 3+2 = 5, 3-2 = 1, 3*2 = 6, 3/2 = 1.5, 3%2 = 1, 3//2 = 1, 3**2 = 9, 3==2 = False, 3!=2 = True, 3<2 = False, 3>2 = True, 3<=2 = False, 3>=2 = True, True and False = False, True or False = True, not True = False.

Example: 
a=3
b=2
c=a+b # c holds the value of a+b i.e. 5
