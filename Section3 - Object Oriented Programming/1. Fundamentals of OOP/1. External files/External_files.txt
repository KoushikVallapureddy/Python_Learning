1. External Files:

External files let you organize your classes in separate Python files and import them into your main program.

Create a separate Python file called my_class.py
    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name
        
        def greet(self):
            return f"Hello, I'm {self.name}"

Import the class into your main file
    from my_class import MyClass

Create an instance and use it
    obj = MyClass("Alice")
    print(obj.greet())

Output:
    Hello, I'm Alice

The from my_class import MyClass statement connects the my_class.py file to your program. 
The first my_class is the filename (without .py), and MyClass is the class name inside that file.
