In this challenge, you'll implement a vehicle inheritance system.

You'll need to edit these files:
    vehicle.py: Implement the base Vehicle class with make/model attributes and methods
    car.py: Create the Car class that inherits from Vehicle
    motorcycle.py: Create the Motorcycle class that inherits from Vehicle
    truck.py: Create the Truck class that inherits from Vehicle
    
Each file contains detailed TODO comments to guide your implementation step-by-step. Pay attention to the import statements needed between files and follow the inheritance relationships. The driver.py file contains test cases that will verify your implementation works correctly across all vehicle types.
