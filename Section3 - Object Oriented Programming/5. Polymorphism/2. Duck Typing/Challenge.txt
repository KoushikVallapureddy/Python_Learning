In this challenge, you'll implement a system demonstrating duck typing with different file-like objects:
    textfile.py: Implement the TextFile class with read() and write(data) methods
    database.py: Implement the Database class with matching method signatures
    networkresource.py: Implement the NetworkResource class with matching method signatures
    driver.py - Implement test cases that will verify your implementation works correctly
Each file contains detailed TODO comments guiding your implementation.
