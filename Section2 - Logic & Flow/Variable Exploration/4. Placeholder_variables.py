'''
In programming, a placeholder variable is a variable that is used to hold a value temporarily, often during the execution of a specific block of code. 
Placeholder variables are commonly used in situations where you need to perform operations on a value without changing the original variable. 
In Python, a common convention for placeholder variables is to use an underscore _ as the variable name.

Using a Single Underscore _:
    # Example of using _ as a placeholder in a loop
    for _ in range(5):
        print("Looping")
    # Output:
    # Looping
    # Looping
    # Looping
    # Looping
    # Looping

In this example, _ is used as a placeholder because the loop variable is not needed in the body of the loop.

Using Multiple Single Underscores:

In cases where you have multiple values and you only need some of them, you can use the underscore character multiple times as separate placeholder variables. For example:
    data = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    first, _, _, _, last = data
    print(first)  # Output: 1
    print(last)   # Output: 5
Here, _ is used to ignore the second, third, and fourth elements of the tuple.
