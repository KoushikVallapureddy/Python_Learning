Constants:
In programming, a constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed during the execution of a program. 
Constants are useful for defining values that are used multiple times throughout a program, 
such as mathematical constants like PI or the number of hours in a day.

In Python, there is no strict enforcement of constants like in some other languages (such as c++). 
However, there is a widely adopted convention to indicate that a variable should be treated as a constant. 
This is done by writing the variable name in all uppercase letters, often with underscores to separate words. 

For example:
    PI = 3.14159
    HOURS_IN_A_DAY = 24
    MAX_USERS = 100

When you see variables named this way in Python code, it's a signal that these values should not be altered. 
This convention helps make the code more readable and maintainable. 
It's important to note that this is just a naming convention; the Python interpreter itself does not prevent you from changing the value of these variables.
