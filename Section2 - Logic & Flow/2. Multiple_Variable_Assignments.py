Multiple Variable Assignments:

In Python, you can assign values to multiple variables in a single line. 
This feature can make your code more concise and readable. Let's explore how to use multiple variable assignments effectively.

Basic Multiple Assignments:
    a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
    print(a)  # Output: 1
    print(b)  # Output: 2
    print(c)  # Output: 3

Assigning the same value to multiple variables:
    x = y = z = 10
    print(x)  # Output: 10
    print(y)  # Output: 10
    print(z)  # Output: 10

Assigning values from a list:
    numbers = [4, 5, 6]
    a, b, c = numbers
    print(a)  # Output: 4
    print(b)  # Output: 5
    print(c)  # Output: 6
