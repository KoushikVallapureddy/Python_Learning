Acessing Values:
In a dictionary, each key is associated with a value. To access a value, you use its key. 
This is similar to how you would look up a word in a physical dictionary to find its definition.

Here's how you can access values in a Python dictionary:

# Dictionary of country capitals
    country_capitals = {
    "USA": "Washington, D.C.",
    "France": "Paris",
    "Japan": "Tokyo"
    }

# Accessing values using keys
    print(country_capitals["USA"])
    print(country_capitals["France"])

# Accessing a value that does not exist
# print(country_capitals["Germany"])  # This will cause an error

In this example, we access the capital of the USA by using the key "USA". 
If you try to access a key that does not exist in the dictionary, Python will raise a KeyError.
