#1. Display Menu
'''
#Display Menu:
In this project, we will build a Contact Book application step by step by breaking it into small, manageable functions. 
The first step is to create a display_menu function.

Create a function named display_menu that prints the main menu options for the Contact Book.

The menu should include the following options:
    Add Contact
    View Contact
    Edit Contact
    Delete Contact
    List All Contacts
    Exit
This function will be the starting point of the program, helping users navigate through the options.
Check the test case for the output format!

'''

# 2. Add Contact
'''
Now, create the add_contact function that takes one argument: contact_book (a dictionary). The function should:
    Get input for the contact's name, phone, email, and address.
    Check if the name already exists in the dictionary. If it does, print: "Contact already exists!".
    If not, save the contact in the following format:

        contact_book[name] = {
            "phone": phone,
            "email": email,
            "address": address
        }
Then print: "Contact added successfully!".
'''

# 3. View Contact
'''
Create a function named view_contact that displays details of a specific contact.

Your function should:
    Take a contact book dictionary as input
    Ask the user to enter a contact name
    Display the contact's details if found
    Print "Contact not found!" if the contact doesn't exist

When displaying a contact, use this exact format:
    Name: [name]
    Phone: [phone]
    Email: [email]
    Address: [address]

Example:
If the contact book contains Alice's information and the user enters "Alice", output:
    Name: Alice
    Phone: 123-456-7890
    Email: alice@example.com
    Address: 123 Main St

If the user enters "Bob" (who doesn't exist), output:
    Contact not found!

'''

# 4. Edit Contac
'''
The next step is to create the edit_contact function. This function will allow users to update the details of an existing contact in the Contact Book.

Your Task:

    1. Create a function named edit_contact that takes one argument: contact_book (a dictionary).
    2. Get input for the contact's name that the user wants to edit.
    3. Check if the name exists in the contact_book:
        a. If it exists, prompt the user to input new values for the contact's phone, email, and address (in that order!).
        b. If the user provides no input (presses Enter), keep the current value for that field (in this case the input will be an empty string, '').
        c. Update the contact's information in the dictionary.
        d. Print: "Contact updated successfully!".
    If the contact does not exist, print: 
        "Contact not found!".

Expected Behavior:
For a contact_book containing:
    {"Alice": {"phone": "123-456-7890", "email": "alice@example.com", "address": "123 Main St"}}

If the user enters:
    Alice
    987-654-3210

    456 Elm St

The updated contact_book should look like this:
    {"Alice": {"phone": "987-654-3210", "email": "alice@example.com", "address": "456 Elm St"}}

If the user enters a name that does not exist:
    Bob

The output should be:
    Contact not found!

    
# 5. Delete Contact

The next step is to create the delete_contact function. This function will allow users to remove a specific contact from the Contact Book.

Your Task:
    1. Create a function named delete_contact that takes one argument: contact_book (a dictionary).
    2. Get input for the contact's name that the user wants to delete.
    3. Check if the name exists in the contact_book:
        a. If it exists, remove the contact from the dictionary.
        b. Print: "Contact deleted successfully!".
    4. If the contact does not exist, print: "Contact not found!".

    
# 6. List All
The next step is to create the list_all_contacts function. This function will allow users to view all the contacts stored in the Contact Book along with their details.

Your Task:

    1. Create a function named list_all_contacts that takes one argument: contact_book (a dictionary).
    2. Check if the contact_book is empty:
        a. If it is empty, print: "No contacts available.".
    3. If it is not empty:
        a. Loop through each contact in the dictionary and print their name, phone, email, and address in a readable format.

Expected Behavior:

For a contact_book containing:
{
    "Alice": {"phone": "123-456-7890", "email": "alice@example.com", "address": "123 Main St"},
    "Bob": {"phone": "234-567-8901", "email": "bob@example.com", "address": "456 Oak Ave"}
}

The output should be:
    Name: Alice
    Phone: 123-456-7890
    Email: alice@example.com
    Address: 123 Main St

    Name: Bob
    Phone: 234-567-8901
    Email: bob@example.com
    Address: 456 Oak Ave

    
# 7. Everything together

Now that youâ€™ve built all the individual functions for the Contact Book, itâ€™s time to put them together to create the full program!

Your Task:

    1. Combine the functions youâ€™ve created:
        a. display_menu: Displays the menu options for the user.
        b. add_contact: Adds a new contact to the Contact Book.
        c. view_contact: Displays details for a specific contact.
        d. edit_contact: Updates an existing contactâ€™s information.
        e. delete_contact: Removes a contact from the Contact Book.
        f. list_all_contacts: Displays all the contacts in the Contact Book.
    2. Create a dictionary called contact_book to store the contacts.
    3. Write a loop that:
        a. Displays the menu using display_menu.
        b. Accepts user input for the menu choice.
        c. Calls the appropriate function based on the userâ€™s choice.
        d. Continues until the user selects the option to exit the program.

Expected Behavior:

When you run the program, it should:

    1. Show a menu of options for the user to choose from.
    2. Allow the user to interact with the Contact Book by calling the appropriate function.
    3. Exit the program cleanly when the user selects the "Exit" option.

This final step combines all the knowledge youâ€™ve gained into a fully functioning Contact Book application. Enjoy seeing your hard work come together! ðŸŽ‰
