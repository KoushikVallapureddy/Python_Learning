"""
In Python, you can combine multiple conditions using logical operators(and, or, not) to create more complex expressions.
lets create a condition that checks if a number is both positive and even:
number = 4
Now lets check if number is posiitive:
is_positive = number > 0
Let's check if number is even:
is_even = number % 2 == 0
We can combime these two conditions using the 'and' operator: 
result = is_positive and is_even
This evaluates to True because 4 is both positive and even.
for more direct approach, we can write:
result = number > 0 and number % 2 == 0
This will also evaluate to True.

Similarly, we can use the 'or' operator to check if a number is either negative or odd:
number = -2
is_negative = number < 0
is_odd = number % 2 != 0
result = is_negative or is_odd
This evaluates to True because -2 is negative, even though it is not odd.
