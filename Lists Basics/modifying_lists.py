'''
Modifying lists:
In addition to accessing the elements of a list, you can also modify them. 
To modify a specific element in a list, you can assign a new value to it using its index.

Here's an example:
my_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
my_list[1] = "orange"
print(my_list)

Output:
["apple", "orange", "cherry"]
banana was changed to an orange
